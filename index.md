### ✈️ ⚽ 🚴 🤿 ⛷️ Free time
I really love attending tech conferences, hackathons and meetups. I am contantly improving my english and french by taking group and individual cources.
I like listening to podcasts, watching youtube channels of googlers (espesially Jake Archibald and Surma), following front-end gurus on twitter (like Axel Rauschmayer) and of course reading technical articles to be in touch with the latest tendencies and bleeding edge of front-end development.
My hobby is travelling, bicycles, football, diving, ski and squash.
