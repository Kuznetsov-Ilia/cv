I've been working as frontend developer for the past 8 years and being challenged to learn the tons of new things that are launched almost every day in the frontend world. During this journey, I've lived in three cities, two different continents and worked for companies like Ericsson CA and applied research centers like UFMG and Inatel.

A while ago, I decided to share the cool things I've learned giving talks and working on open source projects.
That was the best decision ever! I had the chance to meet new developers, cultures and to have amazing experiences.
