This letter is to express my interest in your “Software Architect” position.
My passion for programming started more than 17 years ago and during my career, I’ve
been working with many different languages in Backend, Mobile and very focused in
Front-End in the latest years. I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that
require me to work outside my comfort.

I’m currently working at Cognizant as FrontEnd Engineering Manager
leading and managing multiple agile teams. I really believe that quality is more
important than quantity so I always drive my teams to deliver high quality
products, services, and processes, following the highest standards.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would
like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:

• Wide experience as software architect
• Lead and manage multiple distributed engineering teams.
• Hands-on in Front-End, BackEnd and Mobile development.
• Mentoring, coaching and traning engineers.

I’ve attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience. I
can be reached via my cell phone, +34 692610884 or via email at

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you
about this opportunity.
Sincerely,
