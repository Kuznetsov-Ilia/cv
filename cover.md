Cover letter
I'm writing regarding the Staff Frontend Engineer opening, which I  discovered on Stackoverflow. I have been working as a Frontend  Developer for more than 8 years now, and during that time I've refactored, revamped, designed and developed web applications,  platforms, and mobile apps using javascript frameworks such as Angular (6 years) and React (2 years).

Also, I've experience with UX / UI by applying concepts to make all the projects I participate in, as user-friendly as possible.  I'm interested in working for Docler Holding because I want to further my knowledge and interest in web development, and I believe I'll be able to offer new ideas to help Docler Holding reach and surpass the primary objectives mentioned in its job ad. 

During my career, my core duties included designing user interfaces,  testing and debugging websites, creating documentation, and managing more than 20 developers using Agile methodology. Also, I was CTO in my startup, a platform for collaboration oriented to groups called  Agrupalo. I believe my skill set will benefit Docler Holding, which has the clear potential to increase online revenue and expand its audience. 

Iâ€™m looking forward to discussing the positions and my qualifications in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill the requirements for the position.
