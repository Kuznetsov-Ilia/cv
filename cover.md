Moien!
I'm writing regarding the Creative Lead Web Front-End Developer position that I found at glassdoor. I carefully studied the requirements and came to the conclusion that this is the ideal job for me.
The fact is that over my 13-year career, I have been working in wide range of companies from startups to enterprises and for myself I concluded that a big company with a solid technological basement and a healthy spirit of collaboration is my ideal environment where my skills and abilities can be fully manifested, where I can be useful not only as a developer, but also as a mentor and a leader.
I believe I would make an excellent addition to your team. 
Have a nice day.
Sincerely,
Ilia
